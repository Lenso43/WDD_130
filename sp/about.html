        <h2>Artist, Photographer</h2>
        <p>Hi my name is Lenny Stossel. I am a creative person who has no idea what I want, because what I want changes daily. This creats an interesting situation for an artist. Consider what it is like to work on a multy day project. This means I need to be increadibly flexible. Since I am also not super flexible, this creates frustration that may come out in just about anything that I create.</p>
        <p>As a creative, I create compulsively and often without effort. I have to really try not to take something and turn it into something else. Even making food is like a journy of creative discovery for me. I usually don't cook the same thing twice. I may make a pie and If I really like it, I know that I have a good chance of liking the next cake I make. </p>
        <p>Though rare, there are a few constants. For example, I always like chocolate, and if it is around it wont last long. Those constants tend to find their way into the things that I do. They are my, center of gravity, I suppose. They help to keep me sane and grounded.</p>
        <p>Enjoy the journey</p>
