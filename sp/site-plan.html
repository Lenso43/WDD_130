        Content
      </h2>
      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        <p>I am creating a photo gallery to post projects and creative ideas that I want to share with a wide variety of people. These galleries will share my personal view of the world and my creative aspirations. It is a place where I can share different projects that I am working on,</p>
      <p>Creating a gallery for a wide audience. I hope to be able to attract people who are interested in purchasing my photos to hang in their homes, I hope to attract people who see the paintings that I photograph and post in a gallery, these paintings will be available for sale, I hope to attract my family and friends to keep track of my projects.</p>
      <p>I will use this site to link my Patrion site and other sites where people can purchase my images. I will also link another site that I have which is a site I use for booking clients for real estate photography</p>
      <p>Sharing my personal view of the world, above all, I am using this site as a place to share the things that I create weather it is art or photos of the natural world, trips etc. This is a sight where I can just freely share since I have other sites that are specific to particular business or function</p>
      <p>Share with my family and friends. I frequently have things that I want to share with my family and friends that gets them excited about the things that I am doing. I love the idea of having one single place that I can send them to be able to check out the things that I am working on.</p>
      <p>I frequently have new projects that I work on, for example sometimes I will challenge myself to paint one painting every day and one large painting a week. I can easily send people there to see the daily progress. Currently I am working on a project that I felt inspired to do, that is to photograph every LDS chapel in Las Vegas, I have no Idea what I am going to do with them but I do know that as I do this, I can post some of the images to this site for my family friends and fallowers.</p>
      <p>I am also considering putting up a blog post on this sight since I really enjoy writing about the things that cross my mind. Even so I am really struggling to come up with 600 words, it is true that I really am more inspired by images than by writing, so I think I may just have a space for a blog but maybe I wont post to it that frequently. I should come up with a catchy name so that people will know that I post infrequently. Thatâ€™s it, I am done</p>

        <p>Stossel Photography's mission is to offer high quality image products while offering superior customer service.</p>
        <p>We value our employees and are dedicated to providing opportunity for growth and personal enrichment. We believe that happy employees create an upbeat and positive environment and provides an enjoyable experience for all.</p>
        <h2>Artist, Photographer</h2>
        <p>Hi my name is Lenny Stossel. I am a creative person who has no idea what I want, because what I want changes daily. This creats an interesting situation for an artist. Consider what it is like to work on a multy day project. This means I need to be increadibly flexible. Since I am also not super flexible, this creates frustration that may come out in just about anything that I create.</p>
        <p>As a creative, I create compulsively and often without effort. I have to really try not to take something and turn it into something else. Even making food is like a journy of creative discovery for me. I usually don't cook the same thing twice. I may make a pie and If I really like it, I know that I have a good chance of liking the next cake I make. </p>
        <p>Though rare, there are a few constants. For example, I always like chocolate, and if it is around it wont last long. Those constants tend to find their way into the things that I do. They are my, center of gravity, I suppose. They help to keep me sane and grounded.</p>
        <p>Enjoy the journey</p>
