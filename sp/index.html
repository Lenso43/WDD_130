          <p>
            I am creating a photo gallery to post projects and creative ideas that I want to share with a wide variety of people. These galleries will share my personal view of the world and my creative aspirations. It is a place where I can share different projects that I am working on,<br><br>
            Creating a gallery for a wide audience. I hope to be able to attract people who are interested in purchasing my photos to hang in their homes, I hope to attract people who see the paintings that I photograph and post in a gallery, these paintings will be available for sale, I hope to attract my family and friends to keep track of my projects.<br><br>
            I will use this site to link my Patrion site and other sites where people can purchase my images. I will also link another site that I have which is a site I use for booking clients for real estate photography<br><br>
            Sharing my personal view of the world, above all, I am using this site as a place to share the things that I create weather it is art or photos of the natural world, trips etc. This is a sight where I can just freely share since I have other sites that are specific to particular business or function<br><br>
            Share with my family and friends. I frequently have things that I want to share with my family and friends that gets them excited about the things that I am doing. I love the idea of having one single place that I can send them to be able to check out the things that I am working on.<br><br>
            I frequently have new projects that I work on, for example sometimes I will challenge myself to paint one painting every day and one large painting a week. I can easily send people there to see the daily progress. Currently I am working on a project that I felt inspired to do, that is to photograph every LDS chapel in Las Vegas, I have no Idea what I am going to do with them but I do know that as I do this, I can post some of the images to this site for my family friends and fallowers.<br><br>
            I am also considering putting up a blog post on this sight since I really enjoy writing about the things that cross my mind. Even so I am really struggling to come up with 600 words, it is true that I really am more inspired by images than by writing, so I think I may just have a space for a blog but maybe I wont post to it that frequently. I should come up with a catchy name so that people will know that I post infrequently. Thatâ€™s it, I am done<br>
